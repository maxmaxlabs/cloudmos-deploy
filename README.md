## Disclaimer

- Akashlytics Deploy is currently in BETA. We strongly suggest you start with a new wallet and a small amount of AKT until we further stabilize the product.
- We're not responsible for any loss or damages related to using the app.
- The app has a high chance of containing bugs since it's in BETA, use at your own risk.
- [Only x86_64 processors are officially supported for Akash implementations.](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deploy/akashlytics-deploy-installation#cpu-support) But if the docker image is built [setting the target platform to linux/amd64](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69119815/8215759) it [is possible that it will work from others processors](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/pull/239).
